# Do not use this.
This project was made for the purposes of learning the SlimeVR Tracker protocol.  
It has served this purpose, and thus I will depricate this project, and maybe use my knowledge for more.. useful things.  
As such, I will be taking down the builds, because I do not want to encourage the use of wiimotes for slimes.  
The code will remain available, however, no instructions will be provided (and also, some of the dependencies are now broken, so you probably cant really run it without the builds i have)  
If you truly want to try it, contact me and ill see if i have the builds kicking around somewhere, but I will personally make sure know what you are getting into.  
If you are reading this and are from the slimevr wrangler team, hello :3 id strongly recommend against wiimotes, since it doesnt track fast movements at all, making it unusable for the purpose of slime. Of course the imu is crap in many other ways, but Im sure you know that already.
