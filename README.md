This project was created for entertainment purposes. 
Wiimotes have terrible imus, and are not intended to be trackers. 
Please do not ever buy wiimotes for the purposes of using them as trackers. 
  
This has only been tested with linux. 
You will need to install the cwiid library, which might be a bit difficult.
If you are using arch linux, install cwiid-git from the aur.

To use it, run wiimote.py, then press the 1+2 or the sync button on the wiimote.
Once the wiimote is connected, place the wiimote face down on a flat surface.
Once calibration is complete, the wiimote should show up in the slimevr server.
Only one wiimote at a time is currently supported.
If this fails to connect to the slimevr server, try restarting the server.
You might need to adjust your multiplier. To do this, set the multiplier to 1, then turn the wiimote one full rotation. Then set the multiplier to 360/your rotation.
